# Binary Modular DataFlow Machine (BMDFM)

Binary Modular DataFlow Machine (BMDFM) is a software package that enables running an application in parallel on shared memory symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) computers using the multiple processors to speed up the execution of single applications. BMDFM automatically identifies and exploits parallelism due to the static and mainly dynamic scheduling of the dataflow instruction sequences derived from the formerly sequential program.

The BMDFM dynamic scheduling subsystem performs a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) emulation of a tagged-token dataflow machine to provide the transparent dataflow semantics for the applications. No directives for parallel execution are needed.
